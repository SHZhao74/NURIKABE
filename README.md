Simple Sudoku game written in Python back in 2010.

To run, install pygame:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

and then run:

```
$ python Sudoku.py
```

Bugs

It uses a very simple brute force algorithm to pre-solve the game, hence some
grids can take a long time.  If this happens it's best to just ^C and let it
try another grid ;)
